# dembed

Welcome to dembed! This is a simple tool which allows you to embed several social media sites nicely into Discord.

This is done by adding a simple prefix to the URL. For instance, rather than using `https://www.instagram.com/reel/blahblah`, you would use `https://dembed.page/https://www.instagram.com/reel/blahblah`. This will embed the Instagram post into Discord. So all you need to do is add `https://dembed.page/` to the start of the URL and it will do the rest!

## Supported Sites

- Instagram (Reels and Single Image Posts)
- TikTok (Videos)
